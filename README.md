-   I've used Next JS with TypeScript and Tailwind for this project.
-   The code for the project is here: https://github.com/guywhale/unrvld. It's a public repository, so it should be possible to clone, but let me know if you have any problems.
-   It should be possible to view by running 'npm run dev' in the folder the repo has been cloned into. I've included an .nvmrc file with the Node version used.
-   I've build a products grid with order by price and collection filters. I've made a few adjustments to the design to fit it all in.
-   I've Swapped Proxima Nova font to Nunito Sans as I don't have access to font via Adobe.
-   I'd also hoped to build an accordion (hence the SectionHeader component) but ran out of time.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
